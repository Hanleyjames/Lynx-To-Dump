# Lynx-To-Dump
A live lynx-to-dump api with working chrome extension (pending review on chrome store)

This project consists of an ExpressJS api running on a docker container that has lynx (a text web browser). The API executes a lynx command and returns the results to an email.
The Chrome Extension just makes it simple with a small/lightweight ui with vanilla js.
To install, go to chrome://extensions and turn on developer mode. Unzip the lynx chrome extension and in the browser click on 'load unpacked' and point it to the unzipped folder.
I will eventually just list the chrome extension here once it passes review.
